    content: `<p><em>(Estimated Read Time: 6-minutes)</em></p>

<p>Let's be honest. How many of us have sat through a multi-day strategy offsite, filled whiteboards with ideas, and contributed to a "strategic plan" that now sits unread in a shared drive? Or worse still is something we can't fully stand behind; where we know we have left opportunities on the table; where we've been too conservative & safe...?</p>

<p>For many managers, strategy feels "complicated, arduous, and ineffectual." We spend countless hours creating plans that are often obsolete before they're even approved. The problem isn't a lack of effort. It's that we're using outdated tools for a world defined by uncertainty and relentless change.</p>

<p>But what if you could assemble a "dream team" of the world's greatest strategic minds to guide you?</p>

<p>What if you could combine their core insights into a single, powerful system that embraces change instead of fearing it?</p>

<p>Based on our deep analysis of over 65 years of strategic thinking, there is a way. At least something to consider for your next strategy creation sessions...</p>

<h3>Meet Your New Strategy "Dream Team"</h3>

<p>No single thinker has all the answers, but the best ones give us powerful tools. To build a strategy that works today, we believe that this a need to integrate the wisdom of several modern masters.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Diagnostician - Richard Rumelt:</strong> He teaches us that most strategies fail because they aren't strategies at all—they're just goals or fluff. He argues that every good strategy has a "kernel": a sharp diagnosis of the core challenge, a guiding policy for how to deal with it, and a set of coherent actions to execute that policy. We diagnose this often in our strategy audits & "pre-mortem" workshops.</li>

<li><strong>The Choice Maker - Roger L. Martin:</strong> He insists strategy isn't a plan; it's a set of five tough, integrated choices: What is our winning aspiration? Where will we play? How will we win? What capabilities must we have? And what management systems do we need? This cascade forces clarity and focus; where execution & thinking come together beautifully.</li>

<li><strong>The Market Creators - Kim & Mauborgne:</strong> The authors of Blue Ocean Strategy argue that competing head-to-head is a bloody "red ocean." The real goal is to create new market space—a "blue ocean"—by pursuing value innovation, which is the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost.</li>

<li><strong>The Explorer - Rita McGrath:</strong> She states that the era of sustainable competitive advantage is over. To thrive now, you must master discovery-driven planning. This means you must "articulate what you don't know" and then design low-cost experiments to learn as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Problem: Why One Genius Isn't Enough</h3>

<p>These frameworks are brilliant, but relying on just one is like trying to build a house with only a hammer. For example,</p>

<ul>
<li>Martin's "Playing to Win" is fantastic for established companies in stable markets but offers less guidance on rapid pivots. So, we have built this into our solution and added Strategic Vectors & pivot points</li>

<li>Agile approaches keep you responsive, but without a clear vision, they can lead to "strategic drift" and short-term thinking. Our unifying lens creates clarity & focus and reduces drift & internal thinking. Our solution considers these risks too.</li>
</ul>

<p>The real power comes from combining these ideas into a single, fluid process.</p>

<h3>A Better Way: Adaptive Strategy with the Patient Journey Framework</h3>

<p>Imagine a process that gives you the clarity of Rumelt and Martin, the innovative power of Blue Ocean, and the adaptability of McGrath and Agile.</p>

<p>Our research proposes just that, in a new, integrated model called the Patient Journey Framework.</p>

<p>Instead of a rigid annual plan, think of it as a continuous, iterative & unifying lens. Here's how it works in practice:</p>

<h4>Step 1: Diagnose Your Challenge & Scan the Horizon</h4>

<p>Instead of a vague & quite honestly useless SWOT (see other blogs for our views on SWOT), start with a real diagnosis. What are the biggest challenges or opportunities facing your business? Build out a complete & unifying contextualised vision of your market with our Patient Journey Framework. Identify the Strategy Vectors or pivot points and use these stimuli to look to the future. Don't try to predict it; instead, develop 3-4 plausible scenarios for your business. This phase is about gaining deep clarity on your starting point and the possible paths ahead. And considering, as Roger Martin suggests, "What Would Have To Be True" about the future for your various scenarios or possibilities to come true</p>

<h4>Step 2: Generate Smart Bets, Not a Single Plan</h4>

<p>With a clear diagnosis, you can now generate your strategic options. Use Martin's "Where to Play/How to Win" cascade to frame your choices. Push your team to think like market creators: How could you use the "Four Actions Framework" to invent a blue ocean of new value? The output here isn't a 50-page plan; it's a handful of powerful strategic hypotheses you need to test.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Experiment Before You Commit</h4>

<p>This is where the magic happens. For each strategic hypothesis, what is the fastest, cheapest experiment you can run to see if it's valid? This is where you can frame future Strategic Insight projects - if you need to know more you will be hyper-focused on specific questions & not generating vague & ultimately useless research reports.</p>

<h3>How to Start: "The First 30 Days" are crucial - start fast with the rapid contextualization of all market intelligence into one unifying lens & build unstoppable momentum.</h3>

<p>This might sound complex, but you can start small. Here's a simple roadmap to launch your first pilot.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Month 1 - The Foundation:</strong> Get your leadership team aligned. Form a small, cross-functional pilot team of your best people. Your only goal is to conduct a rigorous diagnosis and define the single most important challenge you want to tackle. Our Patient Journey Framework reporting can be generated in ONE WEEK - imagine how much time you then have for ideation & discussions!</li>

<li><strong>Months 2-3 - Pilot & Experiment:</strong> Now, generate 2-3 strategic options to address your challenge. For each one, design and launch a series of fast, inexpensive experiments. The goal isn't revenue; it's validated learning.</li>

<li><strong>Months 4+ Scale & Integrate:</strong> Evaluate your pilot. What did you learn? Which experiments showed the most promise? Now you can make a real strategic commitment—backed by evidence, not just opinion—and begin scaling the successful initiatives.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>

<p>Strategy shouldn't be a painful ritual that produces a static document, yet another set of PowerPoint templates being filled. It must be a living, breathing process of continuous learning and adaptation. By integrating the wisdom of the world's best strategic thinkers, you can move from frustrating planning cycles to a dynamic system that builds a unified team picture, with intense clarity, where you bring the "outside-in", foster innovation and actually deliver results.</p>

<p>Reduce linear, blinkered thinking driven by rigid templates, stop planning, stop "playing to play" and pivot toward "playing to win", and start building the capacity to adapt and thrive. Please, ask us to explain more; we'd be delighted to show you what is possible…</p>`

    title: 'Course Management in Golf: A Lesson in Mastering the Variable Environment',
    date: '7 November, 2025',

    excerpt: 'Explore how golf & "course management" is a great analogy for strategic decision-making',
    content: `<strong>"Course Management" in Golf: A Lesson in Mastering the Variable Environment</strong>

<p>Golf is often viewed as a leisurely recreational activity, & yet all players should aim to master the discipline of <strong>"Course Management"</strong>. This is effectively how to <strong>"plot your way around"</strong> & functions as a sophisticated, sequential decision system played within a "non-business" environment. Unlike most other sports, the golf course demands that the practitioner contend not only with competitors but primarily with the ever-changing landscape; a physical analogy for the dynamic, unpredictable nature of modern corporate environments.</p>

<p>Golf distinguishes itself as a premier "analogy" strategy model due to the principle of continuous variability and unique problem sets. Golf presents players with challenges that are <strong>"literally unique with every shot"</strong>. This variability stems from factors inherent to the game: organic surfaces (fairways, rough, greens) which constantly shift in texture and speed, hazards (water, bunkers), and external factors such as wind, atmospheric conditions (in the UK that is often rain!), and the lasting effects of previous actions (divots & pitchmarks).</p>

<p>This continuous re-evaluation of the risk profile and the available toolset can mirror the operational reality of business leadership. Strategy is rarely executed in a vacuum; it must navigate unexpected regulatory changes, geopolitical friction, rapid technological disruption, and unforeseen market reactions; all forms of corporate "winds" & "hazards." Strategy can't simply be created by focusing "on my game" & hope to be successful. There is a reason why Bryson & Rory (the two "big hitters") don't win every week.</p>

<p>The requirement for continuous strategic re-calibration, as opposed to applying a fixed playbook, makes the golf course a superior simulation for developing adaptive strategy compared to environments defined by controlled or repeatable variables. Sometimes it means taking an iron or 3-wood off the par 4 tee (not always the "Driver").</p>

<p>Meticulous planning is a pre-requisite for successful endeavors. In golf, effective planning requires analyzing the course layout, considering weather conditions, and performing an honest assessment of one's own capabilities before devising a game plan. This translates directly to the principle that the primary strategic adversary in business is the operating environment ("the market") rather than solely the direct competitor.</p>

<p>For instance, a company like McDonald's must view its competition holistically, recognizing that its market extends beyond other fast-food restaurants to include all alternative snacks, dining options and activities that compete for "time-pressured" consumers.</p>

<p>Golf is fundamentally a game of strategy and precision, built upon finding the optimal balance between risk and reward to optimize performance. This core risk calculation is central to strategy creation in business. On the course, players continually evaluate the risk-reward trade-offs of aggressive shots, such as attempting to reach a Par 5 in two strokes. This decision is made by considering numerous variables: precise carry yardages for all clubs, prevailing weather conditions, course topography, and the player's performance level on that specific day. This sophisticated, continuous risk assessment is necessary to save strokes and minimize high scores, as the downside of "going for it in 2" might be a ball no longer in play or stuck in a hazard, or by "short-siding" yourself.</p>

<p>In life sciences & pharmaceutical brand teams we often see the "strategic" focus restricted to head to head comparison of primary or efficacy point(s). This is analogous to smashing a driver ("the big dog") down the fairway & thinking you've won. Remember Rory McIlroy doesn't win every week!</p>

<p>There is an old golf adage; <strong>"Driving is for show, putting is for dough"</strong>. 25% vs 20% (on whichever endpoint/measure) sounds great to some, but if your competitor (the one's with 20% in their trial) have excellence with a different "club" (their reputation & long-term relationships, their pricing policies, their commitment to patient support & future discovery in this area etc) & with one of those "clubs" they might still hit the same par 4 green you are aiming at in regulation (2 shots) and if your second shot was a bit "off" you might be chipping onto the green with your 3rd shot. Whilst if they can putt better than you; they birdie (ball in hole for 3) & win the hole!!</p>

<p>The principles of Course Management can be formalized into a rigorous three-step framework for tactical execution and sequential decision-making in any complex, variable environment.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Information Gathering and Objective Analysis</strong></p>

<p>The initial step in successful strategy involves meticulous information gathering. Effective decision-making must be grounded in objective data and real user information, significantly increasing the likelihood of success compared to subjective choices based on conjecture or personal opinion. Within the life sciences industry there is now the option to contextualise all data & information into usable intelligence for future strategic decision-making via Strategy Vectors & The Patient Journey Framework.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Commitment and Tool Selection (The Leadership Bag)</strong></p>

<p>Following objective analysis & the connection of contextual intelligence into recognisable patterns and considering various future possibilities a decision needs to be made. The strategic leader must select the appropriate tool and commit fully to the action.</p>

<p>This is the idea of pivot points; find the fulcrum that can move the boulder. But, without the right sized lever (or tool, or investment) applied at the right time in the right way the boulder won't move. Successful leaders are equipped with their own <strong>"bag of clubs"</strong>; a diverse collection of techniques, approaches, and behaviors developed to achieve optimal outcomes across various situations.</p>

<p>Since every organizational challenge, decision, or audience is unique, achieving the best outcome requires critical assessment and selecting the precise approach. Sometimes, the situation demands a conservative, two-step approach (a safe lay-up); other times, a high-risk gamble may be necessary to push quickly toward the objective (going for the green in two).</p>

<p>The critical failure point is being a <strong>"one club leader"</strong>; relying on a single, suboptimal technique for every unique problem.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Execution and Continuous Review (The Sequential Chain)</strong></p>

<p>The commitment phase is critical; a strategy, once determined, must be executed with conviction. Indecision or half-hearted execution increases the probability of failure dramatically.</p>

<p>In golf, once a decision is made, the club selected & the target fixed then the only thing the player should focus on is their technique. Block out doubts, block out the discarded options, don't try too hard or swing too fast; execute the perfect shot (every time!).</p>

<p>The same can be said in business. The easiest thing is to do the execution. If you've considered all of the options and are faced with one option then you must not spread your bets too thin or fail to reach critical mass & therefore not achieve the objective. A failing of commitment not a failure of strategy.</p>

<p>We will work with teams to get past data & analysis & focus on the most effective parts of strategy development; the identification of possibilities and future scenarios and on in to better decision making.</p>

        title: 'The Science of Strategic Insights',
        date: '3 November, 2025',
        image: 'images/insight_aha.png',
        excerpt: 'Understanding the Cognitive Foundations and collaborative practices that transform data into contextualised intelligence and then on to insight is crucial',
        content: `<strong>The Science of Strategic Insights: How Your Brain and Your Team Generate Breakthrough Thinking (pt 1)</strong>

<p>We get asked often <em>"what do you mean by insights?"</em> And, we find ourselves commenting on articles & posts about insights which de-value the critical importance of true insight in strategy development and under-estimate the difficulty of creating <i>"real"</i> insight. Often times people use <i>"insights"</i> when they mean <i>"something interesting"</i> or a <i>"new piece of information"</i>.</p>

<p>Understanding the Cognitive Foundations and collaborative practices that transform data into contextualised intelligence and then on to insights toward competitive advantage is crucial. So, we are going to dedicate a few blogs to this topic…</p>

<p>This is part 1; where we focus on <b>"what is an insight?"</b></p>

<p>Strategic insights don't arrive through mystical inspiration. They emerge from specific neurobiological processes in your brain and deliberate collaborative practices in your teams. Understanding these mechanisms, and the barriers that block them, is essential for pharmaceutical organizations seeking to transform data into strategic advantage.</p>

<p>The gap between data-rich and insight-driven companies isn't about information access. It's about cognitive capabilities and team behaviours. While 69% of biopharma leaders believe their current model meets today's needs, only 30% feel prepared to respond to market trends through insights (Deloitte, 2024). This dangerous confidence masks a fundamental misunderstanding of how insights actually form. Here's what the science reveals about generating strategic insights and how teams can systematically develop this capability.</p>

<p>To appreciate what happens in your brain during an "Aha!" moment we must understand what qualifies as a true strategic insight. Chameleon Consulting identifies four essential characteristics that distinguish insights from mere observations or data:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Previously Unknown:</strong> If you knew it already, then so did your competitor—that is data or fact. An insight provides a unique viewpoint, preferably with longevity</li>
<li><strong>Driver of Behaviour:</strong> Understand stakeholder needs, get behind data and reveal fresh attitudes and behaviours. Provide some future direction and longevity</li>
<li><strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> Reveal new ideas, words, segments, services and offerings that link with a deeper brand promise, creating fresh competitive advantage</li>
<li><strong>Immediately Actionable:</strong> The insight must drive the organization. Even if it requires new indications, lifecycle management options, etc., you should start planning now</li>
</ul>

<p>A true insight in the pharmaceutical industry needs to pass all four tests. Knowing that market share declined 3% last quarter is data. Understanding that this decline stems from a newly identified patient adherence barrier related to injection anxiety that competitors haven't addressed and that this barrier could be overcome through a nurse support program is an insight. It's previously unknown (competitors haven't recognized this specific barrier), drives behaviour (explains patient discontinuation patterns), creates competitive advantage (addressable through differentiated support), and is immediately actionable (program development can begin).</p>

<p>Strategic insights feel sudden and complete, arriving with a sense of certainty that analytic problem-solving lacks. This isn't coincidence—it reflects distinct neurobiological mechanisms. Groundbreaking research by Kounios & Beeman, reveals that insights involve the right hemisphere's anterior superior temporal gyrus, which engages in coarser semantic coding activating broader semantic fields than the left hemisphere's narrower focus. This enables connecting distant associations that focused analysis would miss. At the moment of insight, there's a burst of high-frequency gamma-band EEG activity—the brain's "Eureka!" signature. This is preceded by transient alpha-band activity that reduces visual noise, essentially closing your eyes to external distractions to facilitate retrieval of weakly activated solutions gestating below conscious awareness.</p>

<p>Insights differ fundamentally from analytic solutions in four ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Suddenness: They arrive all-at-once, not through stepwise progress (the rigour of process gets you far; but isn't everything!)</li>
<li>No intermediate states: You don't get "partway" to an insight</li>
<li>Positive affect: The characteristic "Aha!" feeling accompanies breakthrough understanding that can then lead to real momentum across the room!</li>
<li>Higher accuracy: Webb et al. (2016) found solutions accompanied by insight are actually more likely to be correct (r=0.40-0.50) than analytically derived solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>Most remarkably, insight work happens below conscious awareness. Solution representations activate weakly long before conscious recognition. Your brain is processing patterns and connections while you're focused elsewhere—which explains why insights often arrive during showers, walks, or while falling asleep. Individual differences matter. People showing more diffuse, outward attention at rest demonstrate greater insight-solving capabilities. Positive mood facilitates insight by broadening semantic processing, making weak associations more accessible and increasing both perceptual and conceptual attention breadth.</p>

<p>The strategic implication: Organizations seeking breakthrough insights must design environments and practices that leverage these neurobiological realities—diverse stimuli to activate broader semantic fields, psychological safety to maintain positive affect, and permission for incubation time rather than relentless deadline pressure.</p>

<p>In our next blog we will focus on the core cognitive competencies required to generate better & deeper insights…</p>

        title: "It's Time to Retire SWOT",
        date: '27 October, 2025',
        image: 'images/anti-swot.png',
        excerpt: '"Never do a SWOT analysis. And never pay attention to a SWOT analysis you happen to receive" (Roger L. Martin)',
        content: `<strong>Stop The Strategic Charade: Why It's Time to Retire SWOT Analysis</strong>
<br><em>(Estimated Read Time: 5-minutes)</em>

<p>For decades, the SWOT analysis has been a staple in boardrooms and business school classrooms. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats – a simple 2x2 grid promising clarity. It feels like a foundational exercise, a rite of passage for any strategic discussion.</p>

<p><em>But what if I told you that this ubiquitous tool isn't just ineffective, but actively dangerous?</em></p>

<p>What if it's a strategic charade, giving you the illusion of insight while hindering genuine progress?</p>

<p>As a business school graduate who has spent decades working & consulting with teams on strategy creation, I've never found SWOT to be helpful, but I wanted to understand what other leading thinkers have concluded too. I've come to a stark conclusion, echoed by leading thinkers across the globe: You should never use SWOT analysis. Let's unpack why…</p>

<p><strong>The Illusion of Analysis: A Glorified To-Do List</strong></p>

<p>At its core, a typical SWOT analysis is nothing more than a glorified list. We brainstorm, fill in the boxes, and then… what? We're left with four distinct lists, often filled with vague, unprioritized bullet points.</p>

<p>Professor Ajay Sirsi, an expert in customer-centric strategy from the Schulich School of Business, argues that this isn't even analysis; it's an "aimless data collection" exercise. His work emphasizes that strategy must be "outside-in"; starting with the customer and market. SWOT, however, encourages an "inside-out" view by starting with internal Strengths and Weaknesses, making the company, not the customer, the centre of the universe. It lacks the critical step of action and leaves you with information, but no inherent mechanism for making a difficult choice or building a coherent plan.</p>

<p><strong>Empirical Evidence: SWOT as a "Bureaucratic Cul-de-Sac"</strong></p>

<p>The critique isn't just theoretical. Groundbreaking research from the UK's University of Bath in 1997, notably by Prof Terry Hill & Dr. Roy Westbrook, provided empirical evidence of SWOT's failings. In their study of 20 UK manufacturing companies, they found that:</p>

<ul>
<li>SWOT analyses generated generic, vague lists</li>
<li>There was no prioritization or validation of the listed items</li>
<li>Crucially, the outputs of the SWOT were almost never used to inform or generate actual business strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>Their conclusion was damning; <b>SWOT analysis often functions as a "bureaucratic, sterile, and ultimately futile exercise,"</b> a "cul-de-sac" that consumes valuable time and resources with no tangible strategic output. It's a performative act, not a productive one.</p>

<p><strong>Obsolete in a Complex World: The European Perspective</strong></p>

<p>Beyond specific academic studies, a pervasive sentiment in leading European business institutions like INSEAD and IMD, and among many modern consultants, is that SWOT is simply a relic. The modern business landscape is characterized by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyper-speed change: Strengths can become weaknesses overnight (think of a massive retail footprint before and after the e-commerce explosion)</li>
<li>Unprecedented complexity: Interconnected ecosystems, global supply chains, and rapid technological shifts cannot be captured in four static boxes</li>
<li>Need for agility: Traditional, annual SWOT-based planning cycles are far too slow for today's dynamic markets</li>
</ul>

<p>In this environment, relying on a SWOT analysis is like bringing a horse and cart to a Formula One race. It's an analogue tool in a digital world, incapable of providing the dynamic, nuanced insights required to compete and innovate.</p>

<p><strong>Bad Strategy: The SWOT Catalyst</strong></p>

<p>Richard Rumelt, author of the seminal "Good Strategy/Bad Strategy," would <b>look at a typical SWOT and see the hallmarks of "Bad Strategy."</b> His definition of good strategy includes a sharp diagnosis of a critical challenge, a guiding policy, and coherent actions.</p>

<p>SWOT, on the other hand, rarely provides any of this. <em>It's a laundry list,</em> not a diagnosis. It doesn't force the hard intellectual work of identifying the single most critical challenge your business faces. Instead, <strong>it encourages generic statements and avoids the painful trade-offs that true strategy demands.</strong> As Rumelt would contend, a strategy that starts with SWOT is <strong>often already doomed to be weak and unfocused.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Problem of Context and Choices: Roger Martin's Disdain</strong></p>

<p>Former Rotman School of Management Dean, Roger L. Martin, is perhaps the most vocal proponent of abandoning SWOT entirely. His advice is blunt: <b>"Never do a SWOT analysis. And never pay attention to a SWOT analysis you happen to receive."</b></p>

<p>Why such a strong stance? Martin's strategic philosophy is built on making rigorous, integrated choices. A "strength," for example, is only a strength in relation to a specific "where to play" and "how to win" strategic choice. If you haven't defined these choices yet (which is usually the case when a SWOT is performed), then your "strengths" and "weaknesses" are just generic observations, devoid of strategic meaning.</p>

<p>SWOT, by generating long, unweighted lists, avoids the essential hard work of making these choices, pulling you away from building a truly impactful strategy.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></em></p>

<p>SWOT analysis, born with good intentions to foster alignment, has devolved into a superficial exercise that often provides a false sense of strategic security. It generates lists instead of insights, avoids crucial choices, and is ill-equipped for the complexities and speeds of modern business.</p>

<p><b><strong>It's time to stop the strategic charade. For your business's future, abandon the SWOT.</strong></b></p>
