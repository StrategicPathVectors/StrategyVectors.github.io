        content: `The Science of Strategic Insights: How Your Brain and Your Team Generate Breakthrough Thinking (pt 1)

We get asked often “what do you mean by insights?” And, we find ourselves commenting on articles & posts about insights which de-value the critical importance of true insight in strategy development and under-estimate the difficulty of creating “real” insight. Often times people use “insights” when they mean “something interesting” or a “new piece of information”.

Understanding the Cognitive Foundations and collaborative practices that transform data into contextualised intelligence and then on to insights toward competitive advantage is crucial.
So, we are going to dedicate a few blogs to this topic…
This is part 1; where we focus on “what is an insight?”
Strategic insights don't arrive through mystical inspiration. They emerge from specific neurobiological processes in your brain and deliberate collaborative practices in your teams. 
Understanding these mechanisms, and the barriers that block them, is essential for pharmaceutical organizations seeking to transform data into strategic advantage.
The gap between data-rich and insight-driven companies isn't about information access. It's about cognitive capabilities and team behaviours. While 69% of biopharma leaders believe their current model meets today's needs, only 30% feel prepared to respond to market trends through insights (Deloitte, 2024). This dangerous confidence masks a fundamental misunderstanding of how insights actually form. 
Here's what the science reveals about generating strategic insights and how teams can systematically develop this capability. 
To appreciate what happens in your brain during an "Aha!" moment we must understand what qualifies as a true strategic insight. Chameleon Consulting identifies four essential characteristics that distinguish insights from mere observations or data:
1. Previously Unknown: If you knew it already, then so did your competitor—that is data or fact. An insight provides a unique viewpoint, preferably with longevity.
2. Driver of Behaviour: Understand stakeholder needs, get behind data and reveal fresh attitudes and behaviours. Provide some future direction and longevity.
3. Competitive Advantage: Reveal new ideas, words, segments, services and offerings that link with a deeper brand promise, creating fresh competitive advantage.
4. Immediately Actionable: The insight must drive the organization. Even if it requires new indications, lifecycle management options, etc., you should start planning now. 

A true insight in the pharmaceutical industry needs to pass all four tests. 
Knowing that market share declined 3% last quarter is data. Understanding that this decline stems from a newly identified patient adherence barrier related to injection anxiety that competitors haven't addressed and that this barrier could be overcome through a nurse support program is an insight. It's previously unknown (competitors haven't recognized this specific barrier), drives behaviour (explains patient discontinuation patterns), creates competitive advantage (addressable through differentiated support), and is immediately actionable (program development can begin). 
Strategic insights feel sudden and complete, arriving with a sense of certainty that analytic problem-solving lacks. This isn't coincidence—it reflects distinct neurobiological mechanisms. Groundbreaking research by John Kounios and Mark Beeman, published in the Annual Review of Psychology (2014), reveals that insights involve the right hemisphere's anterior superior temporal gyrus, which engages in coarser semantic coding activating broader semantic fields than the left hemisphere's narrower focus. This enables connecting distant associations that focused analysis would miss. At the moment of insight, there's a burst of high-frequency gamma-band EEG activity—the brain's "Eureka!" signature. This is preceded by transient alpha-band activity that reduces visual noise, essentially closing your eyes to external distractions to facilitate retrieval of weakly activated solutions gestating below conscious awareness. 
Insights differ fundamentally from analytic solutions in four ways:
1. Suddenness: They arrive all-at-once, not through stepwise progress (the rigour of process gets you far; but isn’t everything!)
2. No intermediate states: You don't get "partway" to an insight 
3. Positive affect: The characteristic "Aha!" feeling accompanies breakthrough understanding that can then lead to real momentum across the room!
4. Higher accuracy: Webb et al. (2016) found solutions accompanied by insight are actually more likely to be correct (r=0.40-0.50) than analytically derived solutions 

Most remarkably, insight work happens below conscious awareness. Solution representations activate weakly long before conscious recognition. Your brain is processing patterns and connections while you're focused elsewhere—which explains why insights often arrive during showers, walks, or while falling asleep. Individual differences matter. People showing more diffuse, outward attention at rest demonstrate greater insight-solving capabilities. Positive mood facilitates insight by broadening semantic processing, making weak associations more accessible and increasing both perceptual and conceptual attention breadth. 
The strategic implication: Organizations seeking breakthrough insights must design environments and practices that leverage these neurobiological realities—diverse stimuli to activate broader semantic fields, psychological safety to maintain positive affect, and permission for incubation time rather than relentless deadline pressure. 
In our next blog we will focus on the core cognitive competencies required to generate better & deeper insights…

    title: 'It\'s Time to Retire SWOT',
    date: 'October 21, 2025',

    excerpt: '"Never do a SWOT analysis. And never pay attention to a SWOT analysis you happen to receive" (Roger L. Martin)',
    content: `Stop The Strategic Charade: Why It's Time to Retire SWOT Analysis
(Estimated Read Time: 5-minutes)

For decades, the SWOT analysis has been a staple in boardrooms and business school classrooms. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats – a simple 2x2 grid promising clarity. It feels like a foundational exercise, a rite of passage for any strategic discussion.

But what if I told you that this ubiquitous tool isn't just ineffective, but actively dangerous? 

What if it's a strategic charade, giving you the illusion of insight while hindering genuine progress?

As a business school graduate who has spent decades working & consulting with teams on strategy creation, I've never found SWOT to be helpful, but I wanted to understand what other leading thinkers have concluded too. I've come to a stark conclusion, echoed by leading thinkers across the globe: You should never use SWOT analysis.

Let's unpack why…

The Illusion of Analysis: A Glorified To-Do List
At its core, a typical SWOT analysis is nothing more than a glorified list. We brainstorm, fill in the boxes, and then… what? We're left with four distinct lists, often filled with vague, unprioritized bullet points.

Professor Ajay Sirsi, an expert in customer-centric strategy from the Schulich School of Business, argues that this isn't even analysis; it's an "aimless data collection" exercise. 

His work emphasizes that strategy must be "outside-in"; starting with the customer and market. SWOT, however, encourages an "inside-out" view by starting with internal Strengths and Weaknesses, making the company, not the customer, the centre of the universe. It lacks the critical step of action and leaves you with information, but no inherent mechanism for making a difficult choice or building a coherent plan.

Empirical Evidence: SWOT as a "Bureaucratic Cul-de-Sac"
The critique isn't just theoretical. Groundbreaking research from the UK's University of Bath in 1997, notably by Professor Terry Hill and Dr. Roy Westbrook, provided empirical evidence of SWOT's failings. In their study of 20 UK manufacturing companies, they found that:
- SWOT analyses generated generic, vague lists.
- There was no prioritization or validation of the listed items.
- Crucially, the outputs of the SWOT were almost never used to inform or generate actual business strategies.

Their conclusion was damning; SWOT analysis often functions as a "bureaucratic, sterile, and ultimately futile exercise," a "cul-de-sac" that consumes valuable time and resources with no tangible strategic output. 
It's a performative act, not a productive one.

Obsolete in a Complex World: The European Perspective
Beyond specific academic studies, a pervasive sentiment in leading European business institutions like INSEAD and IMD, and among many modern consultants, is that SWOT is simply a relic. The modern business landscape is characterized by:
- Hyper-speed change: Strengths can become weaknesses overnight (think of a massive retail footprint before and after the e-commerce explosion).
- Unprecedented complexity: Interconnected ecosystems, global supply chains, and rapid technological shifts cannot be captured in four static boxes.
- Need for agility: Traditional, annual SWOT-based planning cycles are far too slow for today's dynamic markets.

In this environment, relying on a SWOT analysis is like bringing a horse and cart to a Formula One race. It's an analogue tool in a digital world, incapable of providing the dynamic, nuanced insights required to compete and innovate.

Bad Strategy: The SWOT Catalyst
Richard Rumelt, author of the seminal "Good Strategy/Bad Strategy," would look at a typical SWOT and see the hallmarks of "Bad Strategy." His definition of good strategy includes a sharp diagnosis of a critical challenge, a guiding policy, and coherent actions.

SWOT, on the other hand, rarely provides any of this. It's a laundry list, not a diagnosis. It doesn't force the hard intellectual work of identifying the single most critical challenge your business faces. Instead, it encourages generic statements and avoids the painful trade-offs that true strategy demands. As Rumelt would contend, a strategy that starts with SWOT is often already doomed to be weak and unfocused.

The Problem of Context and Choices: Roger Martin's Disdain
Former Rotman School of Management Dean, Roger L. Martin, is perhaps the most vocal proponent of abandoning SWOT entirely. His advice is blunt: "Never do a SWOT analysis. And never pay attention to a SWOT analysis you happen to receive."

Why such a strong stance? Martin's strategic philosophy is built on making rigorous, integrated choices. A "strength," for example, is only a strength in relation to a specific "where to play" and "how to win" strategic choice. If you haven't defined these choices yet (which is usually the case when a SWOT is performed), then your "strengths" and "weaknesses" are just generic observations, devoid of strategic meaning. 

SWOT, by generating long, unweighted lists, avoids the essential hard work of making these choices, pulling you away from building a truly impactful strategy.

The Bottom Line
SWOT analysis, born with good intentions to foster alignment, has devolved into a superficial exercise that often provides a false sense of strategic security. It generates lists instead of insights, avoids crucial choices, and is ill-equipped for the complexities and speeds of modern business.

It's time to stop the strategic charade. For your business's future, abandon the SWOT.`
